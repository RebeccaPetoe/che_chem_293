1. What does the model achieve?
Understand the linear relationship between the force exerted on an object by gravity and mass of object.
2. How should metrics be interpreted?
The independent variable is the mass of the object expressed in kilograms, and the dependent variable is the force exerted on an object by gravity expressed in Newton. 
3. What are appropriate use cases? 
Mass and force exerted on an object by gravity are two variables that fit with linear relationship
4. How is it implemented?
Applying linear regression to the data. 
5. What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
The data is fake. We need to collect data from a real experiments
6. How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
Mass of an object and force exerted on an object by gravity are directly proportional. The more the mass of an object, the more force is exerted on the object.
